3549	Netlink message header	The Netlink message header is generic for all services,whereas the IP Service Template header is specific to a service.Each IP Service then carries parameterization data ( CPC->FEC direction ) or response(FEC->CPC direction).These parameterizations are in TLV ( Type-Length-Value ) format and are unique to the service .	231	0
3549	Length	32 bits . The length of the message in bytes , including the header .	100	0
3549	Error code	integer ( typically 32 bits ). An error code of zero indicates that the message is an ACK response . An ACK response message contains the original Netlink message header , which can be used to compare against ( sent sequence numbers , etc ). A non-zero error code message is equivalent to a Negative ACK ( NACK ). In such a situation , the Netlink data that was sent down to the kernel is returned appended to the original Netlink message header . An error code printable via the perror () is also set ( not in the message header , rather in the executing environment state variable ).	301	0
3549	Device Type	16 bit . This defines the type of the link . The link could be Ethernet , a tunnel , etc . We are interested only in IPv4 , although the link type is L3 protocol-independent .	231	0
3549	Interface Index	32 bit . Uniquely identifies interface .	231	0
1970	Reserved	These fields are unused . They MUST be initialized to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored by the receiver .	500	0
5096	MH Type	8-bit selector . Identifies the particular mobility message in question . Current values are specified in Section 6.1.2 and onward . An unrecognized MH Type field causes an error indication to be sent .	230	0
5096	Reserved	8-bit field reserved for future use . The value MUST be initialized to zero by the sender , and MUST be ignored by the receiver .	500	0
5793	Remediation Parameters	The Remediation Parameters field contains the actual remediation parameters carried in this PB-TNC message . The length of this field can be determined by subtracting the length of the fixed - length fields at the start of the PB-TNC message ( the fields Flags , PB-TNC Vendor ID , PB-TNC Message Type , and PB-TNC Message Length ) and the fixed-length fields at the start of the PB - Remediation-Parameters message ( Reserved , Remediation Parameters Vendor ID , and Remediation Parameters Type ) from the message length contained in the PB-TNC Message Length field . The length of these fixed-length fields is 20 octets . Therefore , any Posture Broker Client that receives a PB-Remediation-Parameters message with a PB-TNC Message Length field whose value is less than 20 MUST consider this a malformed message . The Posture Broker Client MUST respond with a fatal Invalid Parameter error code in a CLOSE batch .	400	1
5793	Remediation String Length	The Remediation String Length contains the length of the Remediation String field in octets .	100	0
5793	Remediation String	The Remediation String field MUST contain a UTF-8 [ 6 ] encoded string . This string contains human-readable instructions for remediation that MAY be displayed to the user by the Posture Posture Broker Client receives a Reason String that does contain a NUL termination , it MUST respond with a fatal Invalid Parameter error in a CLOSE batch . Broker Client . NUL termination MUST NOT be included . If a	400	1
5793	Lang Code Len	The Lang Code Len field contains the length of the Remediation String Lang Code field in octets . This value may be set to zero to indicate that the language code for the Remediation String field is not known .	100	0
5793	Remediation String Lang Code	The Remediation String Lang Code field contains a US-ASCII string composed of a well-formed RFC 4646 [ 3 ] language tag that indicates the language(s ) used in the Remediation String in the Remediation Parameters field . A zero-length string may be sent for this field ( essentially omitting this field ) to indicate that the language code for the Remediation String field is not known .	231	1
5793	Flags	This field defines flags relating to the error . Bit 0 of this flags field ( the most significant bit ) is known as the FATAL flag . If the FATAL bit is cleared ( value 0 ), the Posture Broker Client or Posture Broker Server that receives this PB-TNC message SHOULD process this error and then continue with the exchange . If the FATAL flag is set ( value 1 ), the Posture Broker Client or Posture Broker Server that receives this PB-TNC message MUST terminate the exchange after processing the error . In addition , any Posture Broker Client or Posture Broker Server that sends a fatal error MUST NOT process the batch that caused the error and MUST terminate the exchange after sending the batch containing the error report . A PB-Error message with the FATAL flag set MUST always be sent in a CLOSE batch since the sender will be terminating the exchange immediately after sending the batch .	231	0
5793	Error Code Vendor ID	The Error Code Vendor ID field identifies a vendor by using the SMI Private Enterprise Number ( PEN ). Any organization can receive its own unique PEN from IANA , the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority . The Error Code Vendor ID qualifies the Error Code field so that each vendor has 2^16 separate Error Codes available for its use . Error codes standardized by the IETF are always used with the value zero ( 0 ) in this field . For detailed descriptions of those messages , see the next few subsections .	231	0
5793	Error Code	The Error Code field identifies the type of error being signaled with this message . The format of the Error Parameters field depends on the value of the Error Code Vendor ID and the Error Code . However , any recipient that does not understand a particular error code can process the error fairly well by using the FATAL flag to determine whether the error is fatal and the PB - TNC Message Length to skip over the Error Parameters field ( or log it ).	231	0
5793	Reserved	The Reserved bits MUST be set to 0 on transmission and ignored on reception .	500	0
5793	Reason String Length	The Reason String Length field contains the length of the Reason String field in octets .	100	0
5793	Reason String	The Reason String field contains a UTF-8 encoded string that provides a human-readable reason for the Posture Broker Server's assessment decision . NUL termination MUST NOT be included . If a Posture Broker Client receives a Reason String that does contain a NUL termination , it MUST respond with a fatal Invalid Parameter error code in a CLOSE batch . A zero-length string MUST NOT be sent since this is the same as sending no reason string at all , leaving the reason unspecified .	400	1
5793	Lang Code Len	The Lang Code Len field contains the length of the Reason String Language Code field in octets .	100	0
5793	Reason String Language Code	The Reason String Language Code field contains a US-ASCII string containing a well-formed RFC 4646 [ 3 ] language tag that indicates the language(s ) used in the Reason String in this message . NUL termination MUST NOT be included in this field . A zero-length string MAY be sent for this field ( essentially omitting this field ) to indicate that the language code for the reason string is not known .	231	1

5798	Next Header	The IPv6 Next Header protocol assigned by the IANA for VRRP is 112 ( decimal ).	231	0
5798	Version	The version field specifies the VRRP protocol version of this packet .	220	0
5798	Type	The type field specifies the type of this VRRP packet . The only packet type defined in this version of the protocol is : 1 ADVERTISEMENT A packet with unknown type MUST be discarded .	231	0
5798	Virtual Rtr ID	The Virtual Rtr ID field identifies the virtual router this packet is reporting status for .	230	0
5798	Priority	The priority field specifies the sending VRRP router's priority for the virtual router . Higher values equal higher priority . This field is an 8-bit unsigned integer field . The priority value for the VRRP router that owns the IPvX address associated with the virtual router MUST be 255 ( decimal ). VRRP routers backing up a virtual router MUST use priority values between 1-254 ( decimal ). The default priority value for VRRP routers backing up a virtual router is 100 ( decimal ). The priority value zero ( 0 ) has special meaning , indicating that the current Master has stopped participating in VRRP . This is used to trigger Backup routers to quickly transition to Master without having to wait for the current Master to time out .	230	0

1967	PPP Protocol	The PPP Protocol field is described in the Point-to-Point Protocol Encapsulation [ 1 ]. When the LZS-DCP compression protocol is successfully negotiated by the PPP Compression Control Protocol [ 2 ], the value is 00FD or 00FB hex . This value MAY be compressed when Protocol-Field-Compression is negotiated .	400	0
1967	DCP-Header	The DCP-Header is nominally one octet in length , but may be extended through the use of the extension bit .	400	0
1967	(History Number)	The number of the compression history which was used , ranging from 1 to the negotiated value in the History Count field . If the negotiated History Count is less than 2 , this field is removed . If the negotiated History Count is 2 or more , but less than 256 , this field is 1 octet . If 256 or more histories are negotiated , this field is 2 octets , most significant octet first . If multiple histories are used in one direction on a link , the history number field MUST be present on all packets in both directions , and sized according to the largest number of histories in either direction . If multiple histories are used , this field MUST be present in uncompressed as well as compressed packets .	100	0
1967	Data	The data field MUST contain a single datagram in either compressed or uncompressed form , depending on the state of the C/U bit in the Header . This length of this field is always be an integer number of octets . This field is required in all packets that do not have the R-R bit set to  1 . If the C/U bit is set to  0 , the data field contains the uncompressed form of the datagram . If the C/U bit is set to  1 , the form of the data field is one block of compressed data as defined in 3.2 of X3.241-1994 , with the following exceptions : 1 ) the end marker may be followed with additional octets containing only zeros; 2 ) if the final octet in the block of compressed data has a value of  0 , then it MAY be removed from the data field . There is only one end marker per block of compressed data .	400	1
1967	LCB	Longitudinal Check Byte The LCB field is one octet in length , and if present MUST be the last octet in the data compression packet . When the check-mode field is set to  LCB  or  Sequence Number + LCB , this field MUST be present in all packets where the data field contains compressed data . This field MUST NOT be present in data compression packets where the data field contains uncompressed data . This field contains the result of the LCB calculation , in accordance with the following paragraph . The LCB octet is the Exclusive-OR of FF(hex ) and each octet of the uncompressed datagram ( prior to the compression transformation ). On receipt , the receiver computes the Exclusive-OR of FF(hex ) and each octet of the decompressed packet . If this value does not match the received LCB , then a receive failure for that history has occurred . The receive failure is handled according to the history synchronization procedure in section 3.5 .	301	0
