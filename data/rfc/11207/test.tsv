3451	A	Close Session flag ( A ): 1 bit Normally , A is set to 0 . The sender MAY set A to 1 when termination of transmission of packets for the session is imminent . A MAY be set to 1 in just the last packet transmitted for the session , or A MAY be set to 1 in the last few seconds of packets transmitted for the session . Once the sender sets A to 1 in one packet , the sender SHOULD set A to 1 in all subsequent packets until termination of transmission of packets for the session . A received packet with A set to 1 indicates to a receiver that the sender will immediately stop sending packets for the session . When a receiver receives a packet with A set to 1 the receiver SHOULD assume that no more packets will be sent to the session .	210	0
3451	B	Normally , B is set to 0 . The sender MAY set B to 1 when termination of transmission of packets for an object is imminent . If the TOI field is in use and B is set to 1 then termination of transmission for the object identified by the TOI field is imminent . If the TOI field is not in use and B is set to 1 then termination of transmission for the one object in the session identified by out-of-band information is imminent . B MAY be set to 1 in just the last packet transmitted for the object , or B MAY be set to 1 in the last few seconds packets transmitted for the object . Once the sender sets B to 1 in one packet for a particular object , the sender SHOULD set B to 1 in all subsequent packets for the object until termination of transmission of packets for the object . A received packet with B set to 1 indicates to a receiver that the sender will immediately stop sending packets for the object . When a receiver receives a packet with B set to 1 then it SHOULD assume that no more packets will be sent for the object to the session .	210	0
3451	HDR_LEN	LCT header length ( HDR_LEN ): 8 bits Total length of the LCT header in units of 32-bit words . The length of the LCT header MUST be a multiple of 32-bits . This field can be used to directly access the portion of the packet beyond the LCT header , i.e ., to the first other header if it exists , or to the packet payload if it exists and there is no other header , or to the end of the packet if there are no other headers or packet payload .	100	0
3451	Codepoint	Codepoint ( CP ): 8 bits An opaque identifier which is passed to the packet payload decoder to convey information on the codec being used for the packet payload . The mapping between the codepoint and the actual codec is defined on a per session basis and communicated out-of-band as part of the session description information . The use of the CP field is similar to the Payload Type ( PT ) field in RTP headers as described in RFC 1889 [ 21 ].	231	0
5414	D	The differentiator field , ' D ', is used to distinguish between WTP variants within a type of WTP design . The CAPWAP Architecture Taxonomy [ RFC4118 ] illustrates that the Split MAC design allows encryption/decryption to be performed at either the WTP or the AC . The Architecture Taxonomy also indicates that the Local MAC design allows authentication to take place at either the WTP or the AC . WiCoP acknowledges these major variants and accommodates them using the ' D ' field in conjunction with the ' M ' field . For a Split MAC WTP , the ' D ' field is used to indicate location of encryption/decryption while for a Local MAC WTP , the ' D ' field is used to indicate location of authentication . The following table highlights their usage .	210	0
5414	C	This field distinguishes between a WiCoP control and WiCoP data packet . Each type of information is tunneled separately across the WiCoP tunnel interfaces between WTPs and the AC . A ' 0 ' value for the ' C ' field indicates a data packet , while a ' 1 ' value indicates a control packet . The ' C ' field is also used to assign WiCoP packets to distinct data and control tunnels between the AC and WTP . WiCoP also maintains logical groups in WLANs with the ' C ' field .	210	0
4302	Next Header	The Next Header is an 8-bit field that identifies the type of the next payload after the Authentication Header . The value of this field is chosen from the set of IP Protocol Numbers defined on the web page of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ( IANA ). For example , a value of 4 indicates IPv4 , a value of 41 indicates IPv6 , and a value of 6 indicates TCP .	231	0
4302	Payload Len	This 8-bit field specifies the length of AH in 32-bit words ( 4-byte units ), minus  2 . Thus , for example , if an integrity algorithm yields a 96-bit authentication value , this length field will be  4  ( 3 32-bit word fixed fields plus 3 32-bit words for the ICV , minus 2 ). For IPv6 , the total length of the header must be a multiple of 8-octet units . ( Note that although IPv6 [ DH98 ] characterizes AH as an extension header , its length is measured in 32-bit words , not the 64-bit words used by other IPv6 extension headers .) See Section 2.6 ,  Integrity Check Value ( ICV ), for comments on padding of this field , and Section 3.3.3.2.1 ,  ICV Padding .	100	0

5415	T	The Type ' T ' bit indicates the format of the frame being transported in the payload . When this bit is set to one ( 1 ), the payload has the native frame format indicated by the WBID field . When this bit is zero ( 0 ), the payload is an IEEE 802.3 frame .	210	0
5415	F	The Fragment ' F ' bit indicates whether this packet is a fragment . When this bit is one ( 1 ), the packet is a fragment and MUST be combined with the other corresponding fragments to reassemble the complete information exchanged between the WTP and AC .	210	0
5415	L	The Last ' L ' bit is valid only if the ' F ' bit is set and indicates whether the packet contains the last fragment of a fragmented exchange between WTP and AC . When this bit is one ( 1 ), the packet is the last fragment . When this bit is ( zero ) 0 , the packet is not the last fragment .	210	0
5415	W	The Wireless ' W ' bit is used to specify whether the optional Wireless Specific Information field is present in the header . A value of one ( 1 ) is used to represent the fact that the optional header is present .	210	0

This packet is used to map the data channel to the control channel for the specified Session ID and to maintain freshness of the data channel . The ' K ' bit MUST NOT be set for data packets containing user data .	210	0
5415	Flags	A set of reserved bits for future flags in the CAPWAP Header .

4233	Message Length	The Message Length defines the length of the message in octets , including the Common Header . The Message Length MUST include parameter padding bytes , if any . Note : A receiver SHOULD accept the message whether or not the final parameter padding is included in the message length .	100	0
4271	Length	This 2-octet unsigned integer indicates the total length of the message , including the header in octets . Thus , it allows one to locate the ( Marker field of the ) next message in the TCP stream .

5414	M	The MAC-type field , ' M ', distinguishes between Local MAC WTPs and Split MAC WTPs . It is used to efficiently realize interoperability between WTPs of the two different designs . A ' 0 ' value indicates WiCoP exchanges with a Split MAC WTP while a ' 1 ' value indicates WiCoP exchanges with a Local MAC WTP . The presence of this classification bit in the WiCoP common header serves to expedite processing of WiCoP and WLAN traffic at the AC . With a single parsing of the WiCoP common header once , the AC will be able to determine the appropriate processing required for the particular WiCoP packet .	210	0
5414	R	The retransmission field , ' R ', is used to differentiate between the first and subsequent transmissions of WiCoP packets .
