5268	Subtype	This document creates a new registry for the ' Subtype ' field in the above ICMPv6 message , called the  FMIPv6 Message Types . IANA has assigned the following values . +---------+-------------+---------------+ | Subtype | Description | Reference | +---------+-------------+---------------+ | 2 | RtSolPr | Section 6.1.1 | | 3 | PrRtAdv | Section 6.1.2 | | 4 | HI | Section 6.2.1 | | 5 | HAck | Section 6.2.2 | +---------+-------------+---------------+	240	0
3549	Type	16 bit . This field describes the message content . It can be one of the standard message types : NLMSG_NOOP Message is ignored.NLMSG_ERROR The message signals an error and the payload contains a nlmsgerr structure.This can be looked at as a NACK and typically it is from FEC to CPC . NLMSG_DONE Message terminates a multipart message.Individual IP services specify more message types , e.g.,NETLINK_ROUTE service specifies several types , such as RTM_NEWLINK,RTM_DELLINK , RTM_GETLINK , RTM_NEWADDR , RTM_DELADDR , RTM_NEWROUTE,RTM_DELROUTE , etc .	240	0
3549	Flags	16 bits . The standard flag bits used in Netlink are NLM_F_REQUEST Must be set on all request messages ( typically from user space to kernel space ) NLM_F_MULTI Indicates the message is part of a multipart message terminated by NLMSG_DONE; NLM_F_ACK Request for an acknowledgment on success . Typical direction of request is from user space ( CPC ) to kernel space ( FEC ). NLM_F_ECHO Echo this request . Typical direction of request is from user space ( CPC ) to kernel space ( FEC ).	240	0
5379	Call-ID	This field frequently contains an IP address or hostname of a UAC ( User Agent Client ) appended to the Call-ID value . A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD substitute for the IP address or hostname that is frequently appended to the Call-ID value a suitably long random value ( the value used as the ' tag ' for the From header of the request might even be reused ) as indicated in Section 4.1 in RFC 3323 . A privacy service MAY anonymize the Call-ID header when the request contains Privacy:user by substituting for the IP address or hostname in the Call-ID a suitably long random value ( such as a From tag value ) so that it is sufficiently unique as indicated in Section 5.3 in RFC 3323 .	230	1
5379	Contact	This field contains a URI used to reach the user agent for mid-dialog requests and possibly out-of-dialog requests , such as REFER [ RFC3315 ]. Since the Contact header is essential for routing further requests to the user agent , it must include a functional URI even when it is anonymized .	230	1
5379	From	This field contains the identity of the user , such as display-name and URI . A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD anonymize a From header using an anonymous display-name and an anonymous URI as indicated in Section 4.1 in RFC 3323 . A privacy service should anonymize a From header when user privacy is requested with Privacy:user .	230	1
5379	History-Info	History-Info [ RFC4244 ] header URIs to which the request was forwarded or retargeted can reveal general routing information . A user agent executing a user-level privacy function on its own SHOULD NOT add a History-Info header as indicated in Section 3.3 in RFC 4244 . A privacy service SHOULD delete the History-Info headers when user privacy is requested with Privacy:header , Privacy:session , or Privacy:history as indicated in Section 3.3 in RFC 4244 . The privacy could be also expressed for a specific History-Info entry by inserting  privacy=history  in the History-Info header .

5379	Via	The bottommost Via header added by a user agent contains the IP address and port or hostname that are used to reach the user agent for responses . Via headers added by proxies may reveal information about the administrative domain of the user . A user agent MUST NOT anonymize a Via header as indicated in Section 4.1.1.3 in RFC 3323 , unless it can obtain an IP address that is functional yet has a characteristic of anonymity . This may be possible by obtaining an IP address specifically for this purpose either from the service provider or through features such as TURN .	230	1

5412	F	The Fragment ' F ' bit indicates whether this packet is a fragment . When this bit is one ( 1 ), the packet is a fragment and MUST be combined with the other corresponding fragments to reassemble the complete information exchanged between the WTP and AC .	210	0
5412	L	The Not Last ' L ' bit is valid only if the ' F ' bit is set and indicates whether the packet contains the last fragment of a fragmented exchange between the WTP and AC . When this bit is 1 , the packet is not the last fragment . When this bit is 0 , the packet is the last fragment .	210	0
