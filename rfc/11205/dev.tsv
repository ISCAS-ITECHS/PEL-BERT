5792	Reserved	Reserved for future use . This field MUST be set to 0 on transmission and ignored upon reception .	500	0
5792	Message Identifier	This field contains a value that uniquely identifies this message , differentiating it from others sent by a particular PA-TNC message sender within this assessment . This value can be included in the payload of a response message to indicate which message was received and caused the response . This value is included in the payload of PA-TNC error messages so the party who receives the error message can determine which of the messages they had sent caused the error . PA-TNC message senders MUST NOT send the same message identifier more than once during an assessment . Message identifiers may be randomly generated or sequenced as long as values are not repeated during an assessment message exchange . PA-TNC message recipients are not required to check for duplicate message identifiers .	230	0

This value can be included in the payload of a response message to indicate which message was received and caused the response . This value is included in the payload of PA-TNC error messages so the party who receives the error message can determine which of the messages they had sent caused the error .

Message identifiers may be randomly generated or sequenced as long as values are not repeated during an assessment message exchange . PA-TNC message recipients are not required to check for duplicate message identifiers .	230	0
5792	Flags	Bit 0 ( 0x80 ) is the NOSKIP flag . Any Posture Collector or Posture Validator that receives an attribute with this flag set to 1 but does not support this attribute MUST NOT process any part of the PA-TNC message and SHOULD respond with an Attribute Type Not Supported error in a PA-TNC error message . In order to avoid taking action on a subset of the attributes only to later find an unsupported attribute with the NOSKIP flag set , recipients of a multi-attribute PA-TNC message might need to scan all of the attributes prior to acting upon any attribute . When the NOSKIP flag is set to 0 , recipients SHOULD skip any unsupported attributes and continue processing the next attribute . Bit 1-7 are reserved for future use . These bits MUST be set to 0 on transmission and ignored upon reception .	500	0
5792	PA-TNC Attribute Vendor ID	This field indicates the owner of the namespace associated with the PA-TNC Attribute Type . This is accomplished by specifying the 24-bit SMI Private Enterprise Number Vendor ID of the party who owns the Attribute Type namespace . IETF Standard PA-TNC Attribute Types MUST use zero ( 0 ) in this field .	400	0
5792	PA-TNC Attribute Type	This field defines the type of the attribute included in the Attribute Value field . This field is qualified by the PA-TNC Attribute Vendor ID field so that a particular PA-TNC Attribute Type value ( e.g ., 327 ) has a completely different meaning depending on the value in the PA-TNC Attribute Vendor ID field . Posture Collectors and Posture Validators MUST NOT require support for particular vendor-specific PA-TNC Attribute Types and MUST interoperate with other parties despite any differences in the set of vendor-specific PA-TNC Attribute Types supported ( although they MAY permit administrators to configure them to require support for specific PA-TNC attribute types ).	400	0
5792	PA-TNC Attribute Length	This field contains the length in octets of the entire PA-TNC attribute including the PA-TNC Attribute Header ( the fields Flags , PA-TNC Attribute Vendor ID , PA-TNC Attribute Type , and PA-TNC Attribute Length ). Therefore , this value MUST always be at least 12 . Any Posture Collector or Posture Validator that receives a message with a PA-TNC Attribute Length field whose value is less than 12 SHOULD respond with an Invalid Parameter PA-TNC error code . Similarly , if a Posture Collector or Posture Validator receives a PA-TNC message for an Attribute Type that has a well - known Attribute Value length ( e.g ., fixed-length attribute value ) and the Attribute Length indicates a different value ( greater or less than the expected value ), the recipient SHOULD respond with an Invalid Parameter PA-TNC error code .	100	0

1963	PPP Protocol ID	The PPP Protocol ID field is described in the Point-to-Point Protocol Encapsulation [ 1 ]. When the SDTP Protocol is successfully negotiated by the SDTP Control Protocol ( SDCP ), the value is 0049 hex . This value may be compressed to one octet when Protocol-Field-Compression is negotiated , or if one of the PPP compression protocols [ 4-10 ] is used .	400	0
1963	(Length)	The optional Length field is present in every SDTP packet upon successful negotiation of the Length-Field-Present Configuration Option . The value of the Length field is the combined lengths of the Length , Port ( if present ), Header , Transmitted Data , and Odd-Pad ( if present ) fields in octets . The length of the Length field defaults to one octet . Valid lengths are from 2 to 255 octets , since each packet must include If desired , the length field can be negotiated to be two octets in length . In that case , valid lengths are from 2 to 65535 octets , and the field is transmitted most significant octet first . In either case , a length of 0 means that the combined length is the same as the length of the remainder of the PPP Information Field .	100	0
1963	(Port)	The optional Port field is present in every SDTP packet upon successful negotiation of the Multi-Port Option . The length of the Port field is one octet . Valid Port numbers are 0 to 254 . Port number 255 is reserved for control purposes ( see section on flow control ).	231	0
1963	Transported Data	The transported data field contains the transported serial data . When the serial data type has been negotiated to be HDLC-like synchronous , this field will contain all or part of a transported HDLC-like frame . A sample transported HDLC frame is shown below . The figure does not show bits inserted for transparency . Only the data between the flags is transported . The flags are not transported . The FCS is tranported unless the FCS-Mode Configuration Option has been successfully negotiated otherwise .	400	1
1963	Header - (CS) :       H	The Header field is the terminal adaption header from ITU-T Recommendation V.120 . As specified in that document , it contains up to two octets : The terminal adaption header octet ( H ), and the optional header extension for control state information ( CS ). SDTP only supports the protocol sensitive operation of V.120; bit transparent operation is not supported . The descriptions of the header bits provided below are derived from the descriptions provided in Recommendation V.120 . In addition to the bit definitions of V.120 , SDTP optionally permits the use of reserved bits to be used for flow control and to provide support for non - octet aligned frames . The length of the Header field is either one or two octets , and is determined by the value of the E bit in the first octet . By default , the E-bit must be set in the H octet and the CS octet is not present . A Configuration Option may be negotiated to allow the use of the CS octet , or even to require its presence in every packet .	400	0
3331	Message Length	The Message Length defines the length of the message in octets , including the header .	100	0

3450	Encoding Symbol(s)	32 bits The Encoding Symbol ID identifies which specific encoding symbol(s ) generated from the source block are carried in the packet payload . The exact details of the correspondence between Encoding Symbol IDs and the encoding symbol(s ) in the packet payload are dependent on the particular encoding algorithm used as identified by the FEC Encoding ID and by the FEC Instance ID .	231	0

5106	Integrity Checksum Data	The Integrity Checksum Data field is not always present; its presence is determined by a certain flag in the Flags field , as described in Section 8.1 . The Integrity Checksum Data field contains a cryptographic checksum that covers the entire EAP message , starting with the Code field , and ending at the end of the EAP Data field . This field , shown in Figure 4 , is present only if the I bit is set in the Flags field . The Integrity Checksum Data field immediately follows the EAP Data field without padding .	301	1
