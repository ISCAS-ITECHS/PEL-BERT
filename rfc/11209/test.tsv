2340	COS	The Class of Service field is used to provide routing class of service . The COS field also affects the Emission Priority of the packet in the scheduler .	231	0
2473	Tun Encap Lim	8 bit unsigned integer . The Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option specifies how many additional levels of encapsulation are permitted to be prepended to the packet -- or , in other words , how many further levels of nesting the packet is permitted to undergo -- not counting the encapsulation in which the option itself is contained . For example , a Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option containing a limit value of zero means that a packet carrying that option may not enter another tunnel before exiting the current tunnel .	100	0

5086	OPTIONAL	Fixed RTP Header ( see [ RFC3550 ])	100	0
5086	Packetized TDM data (Payload)... ...	All the services considered in this document are treated as sequences of  basic structures  ( see Section 3 above ). The payload of a CESoPSN packet always consists of a fixed number of octets filled , octet by octet , with the data contained in the corresponding consequent basic structures that preserve octet alignment between these structures and the packet payload boundaries , in accordance with the following rules	100	0
5096	Payload Proto	8-bit selector . Identifies the type of header immediately following the Mobility Header . Uses the same values as the IPv6 Next Header field [ 11 ]. This field is intended to be used by a future extension ( see Appendix B.1 ). Implementations conforming to this specification SHOULD set the payload protocol type to IPPROTO_NONE ( 59 decimal ).	231	0
5096	Header Len	8-bit unsigned integer , representing the length of the Mobility Header in units of 8 octets , excluding the first 8 octets . The length of the Mobility Header MUST be a multiple of 8 octets .	100	0
5096	Checksum	16-bit unsigned integer . This field contains the checksum of the Mobility Header . The checksum is calculated from the octet string consisting of a  pseudo-header  followed by the entire Mobility Header starting with the Payload Proto field . The checksum is the 16-bit one's complement of the one's complement sum of this string . The pseudo-header contains IPv6 header fields , as specified in Section 8.1 of RFC 2460 [ 11 ]. The Next Header value used in the pseudo-header is 2 . The addresses used in the pseudo-header are the addresses that appear in the Source and Destination Address fields in the IPv6 packet carrying the Mobility Header . Note that the procedures of calculating upper layer checksums while away from home described in Section 11.3.1 apply even for the Mobility Header . If a mobility message has a Home Address destination option , then the checksum calculation uses the home address in this option as the value of the IPv6 Source Address field . The type 2 routing header is treated as explained in [ 11 ]. The Mobility Header is considered as the upper layer protocol for the purposes of calculating the pseudo-header . The Upper-Layer Packet Length field in the pseudo-header MUST be set to the total length of the Mobility Header .	301	0
5096	Message Data	The ' Message Data ' field carries the data specific to the experimental protocol extension . The total length of the message is indicated by the ' Header Len ' field in the Mobility Header .	240	1

5101	Observation Domain ID	A 32-bit identifier of the Observation Domain that is locally unique to the Exporting Process . The Exporting Process uses the Observation Domain ID to uniquely identify to the Collecting Process the Observation Domain that metered the Flows . It is RECOMMENDED that this identifier also be unique per IPFIX Device . Collecting Processes SHOULD use the Transport Session and the Observation Domain ID field to separate different export streams originating from the same Exporting Process . The Observation Domain ID SHOULD be 0 when no specific Observation Domain ID is relevant for the entire IPFIX Message , for example , when exporting the Exporting Process Statistics , or in case of a hierarchy of Collectors when aggregated Data Records are exported .	230	0
5106	Code	The Code field is one octet and identifies the Type of EAP packet . EAP Codes are assigned as follows : 1 Request 2 Response 3 Success 4 Failure Since EAP only defines Codes 1-4 , EAP packets with other codes MUST be silently discarded by both authenticators and peers .	240	0
5106	Identifier	The Identifier field is one octet and aids in matching Responses with Requests .	301	0
5106	Length	The Length field is two octets and indicates the length , in octets , of the EAP packet including the Code , Identifier , Length , and Data fields . Octets outside the range of the Length field should be treated as Data Link Layer padding and MUST be ignored upon reception . A message with the Length field set to a value larger than the number of received octets MUST be silently discarded .	100	0
5191	Message Type	The Message Type field is two octets , and it is used in order to communicate the message type with the message . Message Type allocation is managed by IANA [ IANAWEB ]	301	0
5191	AVPs	AVPs are a method of encapsulating information relevant to the PANA message . See Section 6.3 for more information on AVPs . Each AVP of type OctetString MUST be padded to align on a 32-bit boundary , while other AVP types align naturally . A number of zero-valued bytes are added to the end of the AVP Value field until a word boundary is reached . The length of the padding is not reflected in the AVP Length field [ RFC3588 ].	301	1
5219	C	Continuation flag ( 1 bit ): 1 , if the data following the ADU descriptor is a continuation of an ADU frame that was too large to fit within a single RTP packet; 0 otherwise .	210	0

5219	ADU size	( 6 or 14 bits ): The size ( in bytes ) of the ADU frame that will follow this ADU descriptor ( i.e ., NOT including the size of the descriptor itself ). A 2-byte ADU descriptor ( with a 14-bit  ADU size  field ) is used for ADU frame sizes of 64 bytes or more . For smaller ADU frame sizes , senders MAY alternatively use a 1-byte ADU descriptor ( with a 6-bit  ADU size  field ). Receivers MUST be able to accept an ADU descriptor of either size .	100	1
5268	Type	The type field indicates the type of the message . Its value determines the format of the remaining data .	240	0

5268	Reserved	MUST be set to zero by the sender and ignored by the receiver .	500	0
5268	Identifier	MUST be set by the sender so that replies can be matched to this Solicitation .	301	0
5268	Options	Source Link-Layer Address : When known , the link-layer address of the sender SHOULD be included using the Link-Layer Address ( LLA ) option . See the LLA option format below . New Access Point Link-Layer Address : The link-layer address or identification of the access point for which the MN requests routing advertisement information . It MUST be included in all RtSolPr messages . More than one such address or identifier can be present . This field can also be a wildcard address . See the LLA option below .	230	1
5320	ID Extension	a 16-bit extension of the Identification field in the outer IPv4 header; encodes the most-significant 16 bits of a 32 bit SEAL_ID value .	230	0
